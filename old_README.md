This project is mean't to last for a good while!

Created in order to learn, discover and explore how to create a 2D game.
Starting with Windows as target platform.

The code will be written as I catch up with Handmade Hero :)
Behind for a while now since I decided to create my own game instead of just
following the stream, so I'm starting from scratch!

A lot of the code will be different to suit my style of programming,
and some will adapt of course :)

I don't expect to update this repo very often as I only program this on my one
Windows computer ( backup, what is that good for! O.o ).

The game will most probably be a 2D platform shooter of some sort.
The title is inspired by one of our TNO's: makemake.
Setting will as well most probably be sci-fi/space inspired.
